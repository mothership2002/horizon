# Horizon Framework: Project Status Report

## Project Overview
The Horizon Framework is a flexible, protocol-agnostic application framework designed to handle requests from various sources through a unified processing pipeline. It emphasizes modularity, extensibility, and separation of concerns, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure details.

## Core Philosophy
- **Protocol Agnosticism**: Handle requests from any protocol through a unified pipeline
- **Separation of Concerns**: Well-defined responsibilities for each component
- **Modularity**: Components can be replaced or extended independently
- **Extensibility**: Designed to be extended with new protocols and business logic
- **Type Safety**: Extensive use of generics ensures type safety

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following modules:

### horizon-core
- **Status**: ~90% complete
- **Description**: Core framework components including the system context, processing pipeline, data model, and engine layers
- **Key Components**:
  - HorizonSystemContext
  - Rendezvous processing pipeline
  - Protocol abstractions
  - Flow Engine

### horizon-http
- **Status**: ~80% complete
- **Description**: HTTP protocol implementation using Netty
- **Key Components**:
  - NettyHttpFoyer
  - NettyHttpAdapter
  - SimpleHttpRendezvous

### horizon-ws
- **Status**: ~20% complete
- **Description**: WebSocket protocol implementation
- **Key Components**:
  - WebSocketProtocol (basic implementation)

### demo-http
- **Status**: Functional demo
- **Description**: Demo application showcasing HTTP implementation
- **Key Components**:
  - HttpDemoApplication
  - UserConductor

## Implementation Status

### Completed Features
- Core architecture and component interfaces
- Protocol-agnostic design
- HTTP protocol implementation with Netty
- Basic demo application

### In Progress Features
- WebSocket protocol implementation
- Flow Engine integration refinement
- Error handling standardization
- Logging consistency improvements

### Planned Features
- Additional protocol implementations
- Enhanced documentation and tutorials
- Performance optimizations
- Increased test coverage

## Technical Details
- **Language**: Java 23
- **Build System**: Gradle
- **Dependencies**:
  - SLF4J and Logback for logging
  - Netty for non-blocking I/O
  - JUnit for testing

## Strengths and Challenges

### Strengths
- **Protocol Agnosticism**: Successfully implements a protocol-agnostic design
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each component has well-defined responsibilities
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear layered architecture with distinct responsibilities
- **Type Safety**: Extensive use of generics ensures type safety
- **Extensibility**: Clear extension points through interfaces and abstract classes

### Challenges
- **Flow Engine Integration**: Relationship between Flow Engine and Foyer-Rendezvous components needs refinement
- **Duplicate Processing Logic**: Both Flow Engine and Protocol Foyer contain similar logic
- **WebSocket Implementation**: Significantly behind other modules in terms of implementation
- **Error Handling Consistency**: Error handling approaches vary across components
- **Logging Inconsistency**: Mix of logging libraries and approaches

## Next Steps Priority
1. Implement Flow Engine as part of HorizonSystemContext
2. Complete WebSocket implementation
3. Standardize logging and error handling
4. Increase test coverage
5. Enhance documentation with tutorials and getting started guides
6. Implement performance optimizations

## Conclusion
The Horizon Framework is approximately 70% complete and provides a solid foundation for building applications that can handle requests from various sources through a unified processing pipeline. With continued development focusing on the identified next steps, the framework will become a powerful and flexible tool for developers building modern, protocol-agnostic applications.
