# Horizon Framework Project Progress Report

## Overview
The Horizon Framework is a flexible, protocol-agnostic application framework designed to handle requests from various sources through a unified processing pipeline. This report summarizes the current progress of the project.

## Overall Progress
**Estimated Completion: 70%**

The core architecture and design principles are well-established, with most of the core components fully implemented. The HTTP protocol implementation is complete, while the WebSocket protocol implementation is in its early stages. The project is in a prototype phase (v0.3) with a solid foundation for further development.

## Progress by Module

### Core Module (horizon-core)
**Completion: 90%**

The core module provides the foundation of the Horizon Framework, including the protocol-agnostic architecture, processing pipeline, and data model.

#### Completed Components:
- **Protocol Layer**
  - Protocol interface
  - ProtocolAdapter interface
  - ProtocolFoyer abstract class
  - Foyer interface
- **Processing Pipeline Layer**
  - Rendezvous interface
  - AbstractRendezvous implementation
  - Sentinel interface
  - Normalizer interface
  - Interpreter interface
  - Conductor interface
  - StageHandler interface
- **Data Model Layer**
  - RawInput interface
  - RawOutput interface
  - HorizonContext class
- **Engine Layer**
  - HorizonFlowEngine class
- **System Context Layer**
  - HorizonSystemContext class
  - HorizonRuntimeUnit class

#### In Progress:
- Additional testing and documentation
- Potential refinements to the processing pipeline

### HTTP Module (horizon-http)
**Completion: 95%**

The HTTP module provides a complete implementation of the HTTP protocol using Netty.

#### Completed Components:
- NettyHttpProtocol class
- NettyHttpAdapter class
- NettyHttpFoyer class
- NettyInputConverter interface

#### In Progress:
- Additional testing and optimization
- Support for more HTTP features (e.g., file uploads, streaming)

### WebSocket Module (horizon-ws)
**Completion: 20%**

The WebSocket module is in its early stages of implementation.

#### Completed Components:
- WebSocketProtocol class

#### Pending Components:
- WebSocketAdapter class
- WebSocketFoyer class
- WebSocketInputConverter interface
- Implementation of WebSocket-specific features

## Next Steps

1. **Complete WebSocket Implementation**
   - Implement WebSocketAdapter, WebSocketFoyer, and WebSocketInputConverter
   - Add support for WebSocket-specific features (e.g., message types, connection management)

2. **Add More Protocol Implementations**
   - gRPC
   - TCP/UDP
   - CLI

3. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Add more examples and tutorials
   - Improve API documentation

4. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Add more unit tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Add performance tests

5. **Optimize Performance**
   - Identify and address bottlenecks
   - Improve resource utilization

## Conclusion

The Horizon Framework is making good progress towards its goal of providing a flexible, protocol-agnostic application framework. The core architecture is solid, and the HTTP implementation is nearly complete. The next major focus should be completing the WebSocket implementation and adding support for additional protocols.
