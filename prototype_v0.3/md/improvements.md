# Horizon Framework Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Horizon Framework and outlines remaining work.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Logging Standardization

The logging system has been standardized across the framework to ensure consistency and improve performance:

#### 1.1 Logging Library Unification
- **Before**: Some classes used `java.util.logging`, others used `SLF4J`
- **After**: All classes now use `SLF4J` with `Logback` implementation

#### 1.2 Logging Method Standardization
- **Before**: Various methods like `LOGGER.fine()`, `LOGGER.warning()`, `LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, ...)` were used
- **After**: Standardized to use `LOGGER.debug()`, `LOGGER.info()`, `LOGGER.warn()`, `LOGGER.error()`

#### 1.3 Logging Format Improvement
- **Before**: String concatenation was used for log messages (e.g., `"Error: " + e.getMessage()`)
- **After**: Parameterized logging with placeholders (e.g., `"Error: {}", e.getMessage()`)
  - This improves performance by avoiding string concatenation when logs are not output

#### 1.4 Files Updated
The following files were updated to standardize logging:
- `horizon-core/src/main/java/horizon/core/rendezvous/protocol/ProtocolFoyer.java`
- `horizon-http/src/main/java/horizon/http/netty/NettyFoyer.java`

### 2. Dependency Management Improvement

#### 2.1 Centralized Dependency Management
- **Before**: Dependencies were managed individually in each module
- **After**: Common dependencies are now defined in the root project's `build.gradle.kts`

#### 2.2 Logging Dependencies
Added the following dependencies to the root project:
- `org.slf4j:slf4j-api:2.0.9`
- `ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.5.16`

### 3. Flow Engine Integration

The Flow Engine has been properly integrated with the HorizonSystemContext:

#### 3.1 HorizonSystemContext Improvements
- Added Flow Engine as an internal field in HorizonSystemContext
- Added methods to create, manage, and access Flow Engine:
  - `initializeFlowEngine()`: Initializes the Flow Engine
  - `getFlowEngine()`: Returns the Flow Engine, initializing it if necessary

#### 3.2 ProtocolFoyer Improvements
- Updated to use Flow Engine from HorizonSystemContext
- Added fallback to directly set Flow Engine if not available from system context

#### 3.3 HttpDemoApplication Updates
- Now uses the Flow Engine from HorizonSystemContext instead of creating it directly

## Remaining Work

### 1. Further Logging Improvements

#### 1.1 Logging Configuration File
- Add `logback.xml` or `logback-spring.xml` file to customize logging settings
- Configure log levels, output formats, file output, etc.

#### 1.2 MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) Utilization
- Store transaction IDs in MDC to improve log traceability
- Example: `MDC.put("traceId", context.getTraceId())`

#### 1.3 Log Aggregation System Integration
- Add support for ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog
- Add JSON format logging support

### 2. WebSocket Implementation Completion

The WebSocket module is currently only 20% complete and needs to be finished:

- Implement `WebSocketAdapter` class
- Implement `WebSocketFoyer` class
- Implement `WebSocketInputConverter` interface
- Add WebSocket-specific features (message types, connection management)

### 3. Documentation Improvements

#### 3.1 Language Standardization
- Translate all documentation to a single language or provide translations
- Currently, some documents are in English while others are in Korean

#### 3.2 Code Examples
- Add more comprehensive code examples demonstrating various use cases
- Create step-by-step tutorials for common scenarios

#### 3.3 API Reference
- Generate comprehensive API reference documentation
- Document all public classes, methods, and interfaces

#### 3.4 Getting Started Guide
- Create a guide for new users to quickly get up and running with the framework
- Include installation instructions, basic configuration, and simple examples

### 4. Testing Improvements

#### 4.1 Increase Test Coverage
- Add more unit tests for core components
- Add integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
- Add performance tests to identify bottlenecks

#### 4.2 Test Automation
- Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
- Add code coverage reporting

### 5. Performance Optimization

#### 5.1 Identify Bottlenecks
- Profile the framework to identify performance bottlenecks
- Focus on request processing pipeline and Flow Engine

#### 5.2 Optimize Resource Usage
- Improve memory usage and garbage collection
- Optimize thread usage in concurrent scenarios

## Conclusion

The Horizon Framework has made significant progress with the standardization of logging, improvement of dependency management, and proper integration of the Flow Engine with the HorizonSystemContext. These improvements have enhanced the framework's consistency, maintainability, and performance.

However, there is still work to be done, particularly in completing the WebSocket implementation, improving documentation, increasing test coverage, and optimizing performance. By addressing these remaining issues, the Horizon Framework will become an even more powerful and flexible tool for building protocol-agnostic applications.
