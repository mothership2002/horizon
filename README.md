# HORIZON

> A structural performance framework where your events become stories on stage.

## ðŸŒŒ Philosophy

Most frameworks route.  
Horizon performs.

Modern systems are not just about "handling requests" â€”  
they are about expressing intention, enforcing order, and composing flow.

**Horizon** is a modular, stage-oriented architecture where  
your events are interpreted, orchestrated, and executed with clarity and purpose.

## ðŸ§© Core Components

- **ProtocolFoyer** â€“ First entry. Where requests are welcomed.
- **FlowSentinel** â€“ Guards the flow. Runs preprocessing logic.
- **ProtocolPipeline** â€“ Main processing chain. Connects the flow.
- **ProtocolNormalizer** â€“ Transforms raw input into structured form.
- **ProtocolInterpreter** â€“ Decodes meaning. Determines what to trigger.
- **ConductorManager** â€“ Dispatches to domain-specific performers.
- **CentralStage** *(Planned)* â€“ The ultimate space where logic unfolds.
